# Inventory Management System

This project is a RESTful Inventory Management System built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM. It follows a minimal yet robust and scalable architecture that cleanly separates concerns between controllers, services, and database access.

The system is designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in mind:

- Classes & Interfaces are used for controllers and services, ensuring clear contracts and maintainable code.

- Service layer abstraction allows business logic to be easily extended without affecting routes or database logic.

- Minimalistic project structure makes it simple for new developers to understand, while keeping it scalable for future features.

This architecture ensures that the system is clean, modular, and production-ready, making it suitable for small-scale projects as well as enterprise-grade inventory solutions.
